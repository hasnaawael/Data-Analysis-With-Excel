# Business Analysis Dashboard Project 
## Introduction
This file provides an overview of the Excel dashboard project that I have recently completed. The project involved data cleaning, data modeling, and the development of a comprehensive dashboard to analyze various aspects of the business.

## Project Tasks
The Excel dashboard project included the following tasks:

1. Customer Analysis: This task aimed to provide insights into the profit generated from male and female customers. It also involved breaking down the average spending by customer age groups to identify the most profitable segments.

2. Profitability by Weekday: The goal of this analysis was to determine which days of the week generated the most profit. The findings were intended to assist in making informed decisions regarding staffing and marketing efforts.

3. Product Analysis: This task focused on identifying the top-selling and most profitable products. Additionally, it involved monitoring product return and refund rates to facilitate effective inventory management.

4. Store Budget vs Revenue: This analysis aimed to compare the revenue generated by each store against their respective targets. It provided insights into the performance of individual stores and aided in identifying underperforming or overperforming locations.

5. Month-by-Month Analysis: This task involved providing a detailed breakdown of total revenue and targets on a month-by-month basis. The analysis highlighted any significant variances, which were crucial for financial planning and performance management.

6. Quarterly Revenue Analysis: The goal of this analysis was to compare the revenue generated per quarter against the average. It provided a quick view of performance relative to the norm and helped in assessing the business's quarterly performance.

7. Weekday/Weekend Revenue Analysis: This analysis aimed to compare the revenue generated on weekdays versus weekends. The findings were helpful in making staffing and operational decisions based on revenue patterns observed during different days of the week.
